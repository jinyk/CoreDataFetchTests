CoreDataFetchTests
==================

Test the performance of various ways to fetch data from Core Data in iOS.

There's various ways to fetch information from Core Data. I couldn't find any information online about the gains in performance of various methods so I wrote some tests to measure it. Of course putting an index will help, but how much on various conditions. Is a Fetch Request Template in the Core Data faster than writing out the NSFetch programmatically? How much faster is retrieveing a cached fetch.
